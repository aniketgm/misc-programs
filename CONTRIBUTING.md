# Contributing and Learning

First of all, A million thanks for deciding to contribute here.

So yes, that's my title, It's not just contributing but learning as well. Please feel free to suggest edits or adding a program for anything you would like to have a program about.
However, the question is how do you learn writing program if you just copy paste from here OR anywhere else for that matter.
Well, let me tell you my way of learning.
- **Understand the problem first**
  Yes, before you write any piece of code. First take a piece of paper (or on your laptop or computer), and write out pseudo code pointwise (a rough sketch of the program).
  The way I do is write the pseudo and then while doing the actual coding I write the logic for each pseudo point.

- **Keep copying only and only as a last resort.**
  But then again, why shouldn't I just copy paste instead wasting time. I would say no, learning is never wasting time, Remember Colonel Sanders, he founded KFC at 65. Isn't that amazing. Point is take out time to writing things on you own.

More point coming soon.
