# Contributing and Learning

First of all, A million thanks for deciding to contribute here.

So yes, that's my title, It's not just contributing but learning as well. Please feel free to suggest edits or adding a program for anything you would like to have a program about.

However, the question is how do you learn writing program if you just copy paste from here OR anywhere else for that matter.
Well, let me tell you my way of learning.
- **Understand the problem first**
  
  Yes, before you write any piece of code. First take a piece of paper (or write on your laptop or computer), and write out the pseudo code for the problem in points (a rough sketch of the program).
  The way I do is write the pseudo and then while doing the actual coding I write the logic for each pseudo point.
  For example, for writing a python program for rock paper scissor's game,
  ```python
  # Rock Paper Scissor game
  # - Ask user input
  # - Create list of choices
  # - Create rules
  ...

  ```
  And then while coding ...
  ```python
  ...
  # Create list of choices
  game_choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissor']

  # Create rules
  ...

  ```

- **Keep copying code only and only as a last resort.**
  
  But then again, why shouldn't I just copy paste instead wasting time. I would say no, learning is never wasting time. Remember Colonel Sanders, he founded KFC at 65. Isn't that amazing. You only learn by doing, not by viewing.

More points coming soon.
