# Miscellaneous Python Programs

## Overview

This repo contains programs that I've written as part of my learning of Python and C++ [Python mostly].
You will find here both Python as well as C++ implementations of the following :

- [x] Alpha Triangle
- [x] Rock-Paper-Scissor Game
- [x] Convert Standard Numbers to Roman Numerals
- [ ] Sine Cosine Curve
- [x] Guess The Number

### Running the programs

For running python programs, first you should have Python installed (recommended Python 3.6 and above) and do the following :

   ```bash

   $ python <program_name>.py

   ```
