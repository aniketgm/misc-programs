# Python Miscellaneous Programs

## Overview

This repo contains programs that I've written as part of my learning of Python and C++ [Python mostly].
You will find here both C++ as well as Python implementations of the following :

* Alpha Triangle
* Rock-Paper-Scissor Game
* Convert Standard Numbers to Roman Numerals
* Algo's
    - Binary Search
    - Djikstra Shortest Path First Algo
    - Merge Sort
    - Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree
    - 
* Sine Cosine Curve
* Guess The Number

### Running the programs

For running python programs, first you should have Python installed (recommended Python 3.6 and above) and do the following :

   ```bash

   $ python <program_name>.py

   ```

For running C++ Programs, install g++ (just google 'Installing g++') and follow the steps. It's pretty simple
And then do the following :

   ```bash

   $ g++ <program_name>.cpp -o <program_name>
   $ ./<program_name>
   
   ```

Note: \<program\_name\> means the just the name of the program and not the extension.
